# Stellar Classification

Stellar classification is crucial in astronomy for understanding celestial objects. By analyzing spectral characteristics, astronomers can categorize stars, galaxies, and quasars, deepening our understanding of the universe. This project utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict celestial objects based on a dataset comprising 100,000 observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), each described by 17 features and classified as stars, galaxies, or quasars.
